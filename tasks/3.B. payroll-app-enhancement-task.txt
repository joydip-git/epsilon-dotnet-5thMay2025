Enhancement-1:
------------------------------
Now, Add one more class file: Hr.cs with a class inside it: Hr

Add a new class Hr in the class file Hr.cs in the library application: PayrollApp.Entities
Hr class structure:
	Data Members:
		id (int) -> should be assigned ONLY through constructor
		name (string)
		basicPay (decimal)
		daPay (decimal)
		hraPay (decimal)
		gratuityPay (decimal)
		totalPay (decimal) -> will be set by a method, will NOT be passed from outside the class

	Constructors:
		default ctor
		parameterized ctor -> will assign value to all data members, except the "totalPay"
	
	Properties:
		Id for id -> readonly property
		Name for name
		BasicPay for basicPay
		DaPay for daPay
		HraPay for hraPay
		GratuityPay for gratuityPay
		TotalPay for totalPay -> readonly property
		
	Functionalities:
		CalculateSalary:
			arguments: NA
			return value: void

Now, console app, create an array to store references of the both Developer and Hr objects and their calculated salary will be displayed

1. ask user about the umber of records to create.
2. create an array wuth the number of records mentioned by user
3. iterate through the array and every time
	a. print a menu to the user and ask about whether to create instance of Developer aor Hr. based on the choice, that type of object will be created
	b. store the reference of the object in the array

4. now again iterate through the array and print the salary of every employee along with the name
