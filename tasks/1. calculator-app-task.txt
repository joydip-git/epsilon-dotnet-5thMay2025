	return type: returns calculated value

3. add a console app: CalculatorClient
	1. add reference to the CalculatorLibrary
	2. import the namespace of the Calculator class
	3. create an object of Calculator class in the Program.cs file
	4. call 4 methods one by one and pass two numerical values as arguments and store the return values
	5. print those values
