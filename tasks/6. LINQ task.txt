create an application to sort, filter etc. the products in a collection

create a console application and then
1. add a new class file Product.cs with a class Product in it
	Product:
		attributes: name, id, price, decsription, releasedate
		constructors: default and parameterized
		properties: for all the attributes

	Note: 
	a. you can the attributes and directly use automatic properties
	b. you should override Object class methods: Equals(), GetHashCode() and ToString()

2. in the Program.cs file
	create a collection (List<Product>) to store some sample product objects (at least 3)
	write LINQ to sort the products by user choice (1-> id, 2-> name, 3-> price, 4-> releasedate)
	also filter the products by price between a certain range where the upper-bound = <your choice> and lower-bound=<your choice>
	just select the name and price of the matching products and finally display them in order as selected by user
