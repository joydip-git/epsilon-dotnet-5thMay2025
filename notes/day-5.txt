Array: 
Basic data structure which is available in every programming language
Collection of homogeneous elements (similar type)
Array in C# is a class

Array in C#:
------------------
a. single diemansional array:
<data-type>[] <arr-ref-var-name> = new <data-type>[<size>];
default values of different data types: int (0), bool (false), reference type (null)

b. multi-diemansional array:
<data-type>[,] <arr-ref-var-name> = new <data-type>[<row-count>,<element-count-per-row>];

c. jagged array: (array of arrays)
<data-type>[][] <arr-ref-var-name> = new <data-type>[<size>][];

Array class has lots of static methods:

Array.Sort(...);
Array.Reverse(...);
etc.

<array-ref>.CopyTo(....);


OOP:
Class???
Object???

constructor: 
a special method of the class without any return type, not even void.
name of this method is same as that of the class.
its job is to assign all the data members with values (default or user supplied).

this keyword => reference to the current instance/object within the class code

named arguments: passing the value to a method by mentioning the name of the parameter of the method. this helps you to pass the value to a method in arbitrary manner.

access specifier of the members of the class:
private (default) => within the class itself
public => from anywhere (within the class and outside the class through reference variable to an instance of that class)
protected => ithin the class itself as well as from the child class

self study about "properties" of class

property with ONLY get accessor: read-only property
public string Name { get {return name; }}

property with ONLY set accessor: write-only property
public string Name { set {name=value; }}
