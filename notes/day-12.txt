Built-in delegates:
--------------------------
Action => delegate void Action();
Action<T> => delegate void Action<in T>(T input);

Predicate<T> => delegate bool Predicate<in T>(T input);

Func<TResult> => delegate TResult Func<out TResult>();

Func<T,TResult> => delegate TResult Func<in T, out TResult>(T input);

Func<T1,T2,TResult> => delegate TResult Func<in T1,in T2, out TResult>(T1 input1,T2 input2);
......
Func<T1,T2,...,in T16,TResult> => delegate TResult Func<in T1,in T2,..in T16,out TResult>(T1 input1,T2 input2,...,T16 input16);


Comparsion<T> => delegate int Comparsion<in T>(T x, T y);

EventHandler => delegate void EventHandler(object obj, EventArgs e);

etc.

Functional Programming:
---------------------------------

LINQ => Language Integrated Query 
	a query language/tehcnique integrated into the programming language and has its foundation in OOP language features, generic, collections, delegate and anonymous method, lambda expression and functional programming etc.

write query against source of data in programming language (which is essentially a collection object)

two syntactical styles:
a. method query syntax
b. query operator syntax

method query syntax:
--------------------------
a collection is "queried" through a series of methods of the collection class itself
for this purpose every collection class in .NET offers several methods for repeatative tasks, such as: 
Where(), OrderBy(), OrderByDescending(), Select(), Group(), Join(), Max(), Min(), Average(), Take(), Find(), Any() etc.

Majority of these methods needs some kind logic to be passed in order to accomplish the task. The logic must be passed through a built-in delegate as demanded by the method.


Query Syntax
-----------------------------
a collection is "queried" through a series of operators (like clauses in SQL) and written like a SQL (in a reversed manner)

Note: we do not have different operators for every situation (method)
such as for Max(), Min(), Average() kind of aggregate methods we do not have equivalent operators in query syntax.


implicitly typed local variable:
-------------------------------------------
declaring a variable without any strict data type but using var keyword to do that.
any implcitly typed local variable must be assigned some value so that the actual data type can be understood. this mechanism is known as type inference.

var x = 10;
var y; <- error (must assign value)

class A
{
 var x; <- error
 public var Method() <- error
 public void Method(var a) <- error
}
Note: var is JUST a keyword, NOT a DATA TYPE, so do not use var as return type of data type for the aguments in method or data members of a class etc.
