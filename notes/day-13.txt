SOA (service oriented architecture) and distributed architecture

services:
-----------------
interface IProductService
{
	//abstract declaration of the methods
}
class ProductService:IProductService //service type
{
	//methods (operations)
}

HTTP, FTP, TCP/IP etc.
Remote Method Invocation (RMI)

Service Provider and Service Consumer
the services used to be described using WSDL => Web Service Description Language
a WSDL file is shared by SP with the SC
then SC remotely invokes the methods as mentioned in the WSDL file by using certain URL also mentioned in the WSDL file
any change in the service will force the SC to fetch a fresh copy of the WSDL file

RESTful API application:
------------------------------
provides loose coupiling between the SP and SC by NOT providing any details about the service type and its methods

rather the SP only shares certain set of URLs and information about any additional data to be passed via request body along with the response pattern

the HTTP protocol is the major backbone because it provides several methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and PATCH etc.

SP does not store any information or "state" of the client (as HTTP is stateless protocol)

every request is treated as a fresh request from anyone without any information about the client being persisted at the server side

this type of app does share the data (is sent as part of the response) in platform and technology neutral manner either as JSON or XML data
always the any data from SC to SP is passed in JSON/XML format as well as the reponse from SP to SC is sent in JSON/XML format

SP (RESTful) can fetch the data in JSON/XML sent by SC from the request and convert it to the proper format according to the technology and language using which the RESTful API app was created (De-Serialization) and again can convert the generated response (to be sent to the SC) in JSON/XML format (Serialization)

ASP.NET Core: (Active Server Pages .NET Core)
------------------------------------------------------
	framework in .NET for web applications
	uses "ASP.NET Core runtime" built at the top of the ".NET (Core) runtime"
	different types of web app:
		a. ASP.NET Core Model-View-Controller web app
		b. ASP.NET Core Razor Page web app
		c. ASP.NET Core Blazor app
		d. ASP.NET Core Web API (RESTful web app)
		e. .NET Aspire apps

	any ASP.NET Core web app starts as console app
	then initiates hosting an web application 
	To provide infrastructure for different types of web app different "middleware" are used 
	those "middleware" require different types of class objects to be created automatically in the runtime
	those classes are known as "services"
	you need to configure those services first and then use the corresponding middleware
	these "middlewares" do different kinds of job, such as procesing requests and responses, such as authenticating, authorizing, logging the user or requetst even before generating actual responses as well as post processing tasks after the response generation
	
template: ASP.NET Core Empty Project (generic web app, NOT specific)

Hosting:
	dependency injection
	manage object lifetime
	reading configuration settings from JSON/XNL files
	logging
	application lifetime
	application graceful shutdown

.NET Host => 	Generic host (common purpose)
		Specific hosts
			- web host
			- bakground service host etc.


	hots web infrastructure in console app


Builder pattern:
	Builders build a Host
	HostApplicationBuilder => create a generic host to host a any app
	WebApplicationBuilder => create a web host to host an web app
